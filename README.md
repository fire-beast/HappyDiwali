Happy Diwali Mini Project
This project is a simple web-based celebration page for Diwali, the Festival of Lights. It includes a festive surprise with music, visuals, and fireworks effects.

Project Overview
The project consists of two main HTML files:

home.html: The landing page with a button to reveal the Diwali surprise.
surprise.html: The Diwali surprise page featuring a festive message, an image, and audio.
